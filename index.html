<li><dl>
<dt><strong>Journal of Financial Economics</strong>, Volume 140, Issue 2, May 2021, 412–435.</dt>
<dd><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
We show that at-the-money implied volatility of options on futures of 5-year Treasury notes (Treasury ‘yield implied volatility’) predicts both the growth rate and volatility of gross domestic product, as well as of other macroeconomic variables, like industrial production, consumption, and employment. This predictability is robust to controlling for the term spread, credit spread, stock returns, stock market implied volatility, and several other variables that prior literature showed to predict macroeconomic activity. Our results indicate that Treasury yield implied volatility is a useful forward-looking state variable to characterize risks and opportunities in the macro economy.

<ul>
<li><em>With Francis A. Longstaff</em></li>
<li><dl>
<dt><strong>Review of Financial Studies</strong>, Volume 33, Issue 11, 2020, 5051–5091.</dt>
<dd><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
A long-standing asset pricing puzzle is that the funding rates in derivatives contracts often differ from those in cash markets. We propose that the cost of renting intermediary balance sheet space may help resolve this puzzle. We study a persistent basis in what is arguably the largest derivatives market, namely, the interest rate futures market. This basis is strongly related to exogenous measures of intermediary balance sheet usage and proxies for the balance sheet costs imposed by debt overhang problems and capital regulation. These results extend to the cash derivatives bases documented in many of the other largest financial markets.

<ul>
<li><em>With Francis A. Longstaff</em></li>
<li><dl>
<dt><strong>Journal of Financial Economics</strong>, Volume 137, Issue 3, 2020, 637–658.</dt>
<dd><strong>Abstract:</strong> We find that Treasury floating rate notes (FRNs) trade at a significant premium relative to the prices of Treasury bills and notes. This premium is directly related to the near-constant nature of FRN prices and is correlated with measures reflecting investor demand for safe assets. Money market funds are often the primary investors in FRNs, and the FRN premium is related to flows into funds with fixed net asset values, but not to flows into funds with variable net asset values. These results provide strong evidence that the FRN premium represents a convenience yield for the mark-to-market stability feature of FRNs.

<li><em>With Francis A. Longstaff and Ilya A. Strebulaev</em></li>
<li><dl>
<dt><strong>Critical Finance Review</strong>, Volume 9: No. 1–2, 2020, 1–28.</dt>
<dd><strong>Abstract:</strong> We study the time series relation between leverage and corporate tax rates using an extensive data set constructed from all corporate income tax returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service from 1926 to 2013. This data set includes financial statement data from millions of private and public corporations. We find strong evidence that changes in corporate leverage are directly related to changes in corporate tax rates for all but the smallest firms. These results are robust to the inclusion of control variables for the costs of financial distress, corporate liquidity, and capital market and macroeconomic conditions. Furthermore, the results hold for both financial and nonfinancial firms as well as for different measures of firm leverage and the marginal corporate income tax rate. An increase in the marginal corporate tax rate of 1% translates into a 0.15% increase in corporate leverage, representing a $132 billion increase in aggregate leverage based on current values.

<ul>
<li><em>With Francis A. Longstaff and Hanno Lustig</em></li>
<li><dl>
<dt><strong>Review of Financial Studies</strong>, Volume 30, Issue 8, 2017, 2719–2760.</dt>
<dd><strong>Abstract:</strong> We study the nature of deflation risk by extracting the objective distribution of inflation from the market prices of inflation swaps and options. We find that the market expects inflation to average about 2.5% over the next 30 years. Despite this, the market places substantial weight on deflation scenarios in which prices significantly decline over extended horizons. The market prices the economic tail risk of deflation similarly to other types of tail risks, such as corporate default or catastrophic insurance losses. We find that deflation risk is strongly negatively correlated with outcomes in the financial markets and with consumer confidence.

<ul>
<li><em>With Francis A. Longstaff and Hanno Lustig</em></li>
<li><strong>Journal of Finance</strong>, Volume 69, Issue 5, 2014, 2151–2197.</li>
<li><dl>
<dt><strong><em>Winner of the Amundi Smith Breeden Award 2014</em></strong></dt>
<dd><strong>Abstract:</strong> We show that the price of a Treasury bond and an inflation‐swapped Treasury Inflation‐Protected Securities (TIPS) issue exactly replicating the cash flows of the Treasury bond can differ by more than $20 per $100 notional. Treasury bonds are almost always overvalued relative to TIPS. Total TIPS‐Treasury mispricing has exceeded $56 billion, representing nearly 8% of the total amount of TIPS outstanding. We find direct evidence that the mispricing narrows as additional capital flows into the markets. This provides strong support for the slow-moving-capital explanation of arbitrage persistence.

<dt>UCLA Anderson Review, Research Brief, featured article December 16, 2020.</dt>
<dd><strong>Abstract:</strong> We use the prices of credit card asset-backed securities to study the market risk premium associated with unsecured consumer credit risk. The consumer credit risk premium has historically been comparable to high yield corporate bond spreads, but has increased dramatically since the financial crisis. We find evidence that this increase is primarily due to balance-sheet costs imposed by recent changes in regulatory capital requirements which have effectively placed credit card securitizations back onto issuer balance sheets. These changes in capital regulation may have added hundreds of basis points to the cost of unsecured household credit.

<li><dl>
<dt>NBER Working Paper 28134, 2020.</dt>
<dd><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present a new approach for estimating private equity returns using secondary market prices for entrepreneurial business credit card securitizations. We show that the market requires a significantly higher premium for entrepreneurial credit risk than for household credit risk. Entrepreneurial risk is systematic in nature and has much in common with risks in corporate bond and real-estate-backed lending markets. The expected return on private equity is on the order of 14 percent and the volatility of private equity returns is comparable to that of the smallest quintile of publicly traded firms.

<ul>
<li><em>With Priyank Gandhi and Pengjie Gao</em></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Working Paper. 2020.</dt>
<dd><strong>Abstract:</strong> Little is known about how the risk of unexpected changes in tax policy is priced in financial markets. We measure how tax risk affects asset prices using a novel dataset of taxable and tax-exempt corporate bonds in the 19th century, and the introduction of federal taxes as a natural experiment. Our tax risk measure is derived from bonds with a tax-exempt clause that requires firms to pay coupons to investors in full, and to pay investors’ taxes on coupons. Tax risk is pro-cyclical and is priced in the cross-section of asset returns with a statistically and economically significant positive risk premium.

<p>I am Assistant Professor of Finance at the University of Delaware. My research interests include the role of arbitrage in financial markets, fixed income markets, term structure theory, derivative securities, and credit risk.</p>
<p>My research has been published in top finance journals including the Journal of Finance, the Review of Financial Studies, and the Journal of Financial Economics. Several of my recent research papers have focused on frictions in financial markets that give rise to violations of the law of one price.</p>
<p>My joint work with Francis A. Longstaff and Hanno Lustig on the U.S. Treasury bond and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) markets was awarded the 2014 Amundi Smith Breeden, and was featured in the Financial Times, and the Economist. I am a frequent speaker at academic conferences, practitioner seminars, and regulatory agencies (CFTC).</p>
<p>Prior to joining the University of Delaware, I worked as Associate at Cornerstone Research in New York on legal cases involving the valuation of over-the-counter and exchange-traded financial securities, including credit default swaps, foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives, and commodity-linked instruments.</p>
<p>I have a Ph.D. in Finance from the Anderson School at UCLA, and also Masters’ Degrees in Financial Engineering, Business Administration (MBA), and Industrial Engineering. I have experience teaching at the undergraduate, MBA, and executive education levels.</p>
