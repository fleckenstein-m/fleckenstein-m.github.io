  : __Abstract__<br />
  We provide estimates of Treasury convenience premia across the entire term structure of Treasury bills, notes, and bonds over more than a quarter of a century and document a variety of key stylized facts about their time-series and cross-sectional patterns. These results raise concerns about the evolving nature of Treasury markets and suggest that investors may now place less weight on the traditional role of Treasury securities as liquid trading vehicles. These stylized facts provide empirical benchmarks that could help guide future theoretical and empirical work about the economics of safe assets in financial markets.


+ [Small Business Equity Returns: Empirical Evidence from the Business Credit Card Securitization Market (2023)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13200)

  - __Journal of Finance__, Volume 78, Issue 1, February 2023, 389--425.
  - [UCLA Anderson Review](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/borrowings-suggest-small-company-owners-face-higher-risk/), Research Brief, featured article July 28, 2021.
  : __Abstract__<br />
  We present a new approach for estimating small business equity returns. This approach applies the Merton (1974) credit model to the returns on entrepreneurial business credit card debt securitizations and solves for the implied equity returns for the small businesses owned by the cardholders. The estimated small business equity premium is 10.74%. The standard deviation of small business equity returns is 56.37%. We validate the methodology by applying it to investment-grade corporate bonds and recovering a public equity premium of 6.17%.


+ [The Market Risk Premium for Unsecured Consumer Credit Risk (2022)](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/35/10/4756/6500307)  
  - *With Francis A. Longstaff*
  - __Review of Financial Studies__, Volume 35, Issue 10, October 2022, 4756--4801.
  - NBER Featured Working Papers, January 14, 2021.
  - [UCLA Anderson Review](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/did-bank-capital-rules-make-credit-card-borrowing-more-expensive/), Research Brief, featured article December 16, 2020.
  : __Abstract__<br />
  We use the prices of credit card asset-backed securities to study the market risk premium associated with unsecured consumer credit risk. We find that the market incorporates a substantial credit risk premium into the prices of these securities. Furthermore, there has been a major repricing of unsecured consumer credit risk since the 2007–2009 financial crisis. We find evidence that this increase is linked to balance-sheet costs imposed by postcrisis changes in regulations that have placed credit card securitizations back onto issuer balance sheets. These regulatory changes may have added more than 100 basis points to the cost of unsecured household credit. 


+ [Treasury Yield Implied Volatility and Real Activity (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2020.12.009)  
  - *With Priyank Gandhi and Martijn Cremers*
  - __Journal of Financial Economics__, Volume 140, Issue 2, May 2021, 412--435.
  : __Abstract__<br />
  We show that at-the-money implied volatility of options on futures of 5-year Treasury notes (Treasury ‘yield implied volatility’) predicts both the growth rate and volatility of gross domestic product, as well as of other macroeconomic variables, like industrial production, consumption, and employment. This predictability is robust to controlling for the term spread, credit spread, stock returns, stock market implied volatility, and several other variables that prior literature showed to predict macroeconomic activity. Our results indicate that Treasury yield implied volatility is a useful forward-looking state variable to characterize risks and opportunities in the macro economy.


+ [Renting Balance Sheet Space: Intermediary Balance Sheet Rental Costs and the Valuation of Derivatives (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhaa033)  
  - *With Francis A. Longstaff*
  - __Review of Financial Studies__, Volume 33, Issue 11, November 2020, 5051--5091. 
  - [UCLA Anderson Review](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/banks-rent-out-their-balance-sheets-so-derivatives-cost-more/), Research Brief, featured article November 17, 2021.
  : __Abstract__<br />
  A long-standing asset pricing puzzle is that the funding rates in derivatives contracts often differ from those in cash markets. We propose that the cost of renting intermediary balance sheet space may help resolve this puzzle. We study a persistent basis in what is arguably the largest derivatives market, namely, the interest rate futures market. This basis is strongly related to exogenous measures of intermediary balance sheet usage and proxies for the balance sheet costs imposed by debt overhang problems and capital regulation. These results extend to the cash derivatives bases documented in many of the other largest financial markets.


+ [The U.S. Treasury Floating Rate Note Puzzle: Is there a Premium for Mark-to-Market Stability? (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2020.04.006)  
  - *With Francis A. Longstaff*
  - __Journal of Financial Economics__, Volume 137, Issue 3, September 2020, 637--658.
  : __Abstract__<br />
  We find that Treasury floating rate notes (FRNs) trade at a significant premium relative to the prices of Treasury bills and notes. This premium is directly related to the near-constant nature of FRN prices and is correlated with measures reflecting investor demand for safe assets. Money market funds are often the primary investors in FRNs, and the FRN premium is related to flows into funds with fixed net asset values, but not to flows into funds with variable net asset values. These results provide strong evidence that the FRN premium represents a convenience yield for the mark-to-market stability feature of FRNs.  
  

+ [Corporate Taxes and Capital Structure: A Long-Term Historical Perspective (2020)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/104.00000069)
  - *With Francis A. Longstaff and Ilya A. Strebulaev*
  - __Critical Finance Review__, Volume 9: No. 1--2, 2020, 1--28.
  : __Abstract__<br />
  We study the time series relation between leverage and corporate tax rates using an extensive data set constructed from all corporate income tax returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service from 1926 to 2013. This data set includes financial statement data from millions of private and public corporations. We find strong evidence that changes in corporate leverage are directly related to changes in corporate tax rates for all but the smallest firms. These results are robust to the inclusion of control variables for the costs of financial distress, corporate liquidity, and capital market and macroeconomic conditions. Furthermore, the results hold for both financial and nonfinancial firms as well as for different measures of firm leverage and the marginal corporate income tax rate. An increase in the marginal corporate tax rate of 1% translates into a 0.15% increase in corporate leverage, representing a $132 billion increase in aggregate leverage based on current values.


+ [Deflation Risk (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhx021)  
  - *With Francis A. Longstaff and Hanno Lustig*
  - __Review of Financial Studies__, Volume 30, Issue 8, August 2017, 2719--2760.
  : __Abstract__<br />
  We study the nature of deflation risk by extracting the objective distribution of inflation from the market prices of inflation swaps and options. We find that the market expects inflation to average about 2.5% over the next 30 years. Despite this, the market places substantial weight on deflation scenarios in which prices significantly decline over extended horizons. The market prices the economic tail risk of deflation similarly to other types of tail risks, such as corporate default or catastrophic insurance losses. We find that deflation risk is strongly negatively correlated with outcomes in the financial markets and with consumer confidence.


+ [The TIPS--Treasury Bond Puzzle (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12032)  
  - *With Francis A. Longstaff and Hanno Lustig*
  - __Journal of Finance__, Volume 69, Issue 5, October 2014, 2151--2197.
  - **_Winner of the Amundi Smith Breeden Award 2014_**.
  : __Abstract__<br />
  We show that the price of a Treasury bond and an inflation‐swapped Treasury Inflation‐Protected Securities (TIPS) issue exactly replicating the cash flows of the Treasury bond can differ by more than $20 per $100 notional. Treasury bonds are almost always overvalued relative to TIPS. Total TIPS‐-Treasury mispricing has exceeded $56 billion, representing nearly 8% of the total amount of TIPS outstanding. We find direct evidence that the mispricing narrows as additional capital flows into the markets. This provides strong support for the slow-moving-capital explanation of arbitrage persistence.

## Working Papers

+ [Is Maturity Transformation Risk Priced Into Bank Deposit Rates?](https://www.nber.org/papers/w32724)
  - *With Francis A. Longstaff*
  - NBER Working Paper 32724, 2024.
  : __Abstract__<br />
  We use the term structure of bank CD rates to examine whether maturity-transformation risk is
  priced into the rates banks offer customers. We find that depositors pay a significant cost for the
  liquidity provided by bank deposits. This cost is strongly related to the amount of maturity-transformation
  risk that these deposit accounts create. The cost is also negatively correlated with
  the convenience premia in Treasury markets, which suggests that households do not view deposit
  liquidity and Treasury liquidity as perfect substitutes. The results have important implications
  about the role of deposit franchises and market power in banking markets.


+ [Financial Sophistication and Bank Market Power](https://www.nber.org/papers/w33049)
  - *With Francis A. Longstaff*
  - NBER Working Paper 33049, 2024.
  - [UCLA Anderson Review](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/cd-withdrawal-penalties-often-more-than-worth-the-risk/), Research Brief, featured article November 13, 2024.
  - [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/short-term-cds-long-term-investments-6da40236?mod=ig_investingmonthlyreport), April 2, 2025.
  : __Abstract__<br />
  We study the relation between bank funding costs and the financial sophistication of bank customers. 
  In doing this, we make use of a natural experiment that allows us to identify banks that--either intentionally or unintentionally--price time deposits in a way that can result in financially-unsophisticated customers essentially being shortchanged. 
  We find that these banks have significantly lower deposit funding costs. These results provide evidence that having financially-unsophisticated customers may provide banks with substantial market power and be an important component of the value of a bank's deposit franchise.


+ [Do Municipal Bond Investors Pay a Convenience Premium to Avoid Taxes?](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31389)
  - *With Francis A. Longstaff*
  - Revise and Resubmit at Review of Financial Studies.
  - NBER Working Paper 31389, 2023. 
  - [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/municipal-bonds-tax-free-price-74d4bbcf), September 3, 2023.
  - [UCLA Anderson Review](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/muni-bond-buyers-pay-a-little-extra-for-the-pleasure-of-not-being-taxed/), Research Brief, featured article August 2, 2023.
  : __Abstract__<br />
  We study the valuation of state-issued tax-exempt municipal bonds and find that there are significant convenience premia in their prices. These premia parallel those identified in Treasury markets. We find evidence that these premia are tax related. Specifically, the premia are related to measures of
  tax and fiscal uncertainty, forecast flows into state municipal bond funds, and are directly linked to outmigration from high-tax to low-tax states and to other measures of tax aversion such as IRA and retirement plan contributions. 
  These results suggest that investors are willing to pay a substantial premium to avoid taxes.


+ [Tax Policy Uncertainty and Asset Prices: Evidence from Dual-class Corporate Bonds in the Early 20th Century](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3364309)  
  - *With Priyank Gandhi and Pengjie Gao*
  - Working Paper, 2020.
  : __Abstract__<br />
  Little is known about how the risk of unexpected changes in tax policy is priced in financial markets. We measure how tax risk affects asset prices using a novel dataset of taxable and tax-exempt corporate bonds in the 19th century, and the introduction of federal taxes as a natural experiment. Our tax risk measure is derived from bonds with a tax-exempt clause that requires firms to pay coupons to investors in full, and to pay investors’ taxes on coupons. Tax risk is pro-cyclical and is priced in the cross-section of asset returns with a statistically and economically significant positive risk premium.

## Work in Progress
+ [Benchmark Interest Rates in the SOFR Era]()
  - *With Sven Klingler and Olav Syrstad*
  : __Abstract__<br />
  The adoption of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as variable rate for
  interest rate swaps introduces a new class of benchmark interest rates. Guided by
  no-arbitrage arguments, we establish three novel facts about these rates. First, the
  spread between swap rates linked to the effective FED funds rate (FFR) and SOFR
  provides a novel measure of expected Treasury repo financing costs over specific
  horizons. Second, SOFR swap spreads—the difference between SOFR swap rates
  and Treasury yields—exhibit lower volatility and reduced sensitivity to Treasury
  convenience premiums compared to their FFR counterparts. Finally, the term
  structure of FFR-SOFR spreads explains SOFR swap spreads beyond short-term
  FFR-SOFR spread levels.

+ [The Last Days of LIBOR]()
  - *With Sven Klingler and Olav Syrstad*
  : __Abstract__<br />
  We use the “last days of LIBOR”, the period before the last published London
  Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), to study how financial markets adapt to changes
  imposed by regulators. Focusing on interest rate derivatives, we find that their
  prices respond quickly to regulatory changes affecting their cash flows. This response
  spills over to unaffected contracts, resembling a liquidity spiral. Moreover,
  an unexpected regulatory change can have a lasting impact as markets incorporate
  the risk of future unexpected changes. Our findings provide insights into
  market reactions to policy shifts, highlighting risks to market resilience and the
  importance of predictable regulatory implementation..
